# Game Probability Simulation

Probability simulation code for my game (a project in the `MDM4U` course)

Includes:

- Theoretical probabilities
- Experimental probabilities
- Distribution tables
- Distribution graphs
- Expected values

Run `generate.py` to generate all tables, graphs and the expected values
